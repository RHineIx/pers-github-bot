## ‚ú® Key Features

### ü§ñ AI-Powered Summaries

Utilizes the Google Gemini Pro AI to read and summarize `README.md` files, providing you with a smart, concise description of what each project does, its purpose, and its key features.

### üñºÔ∏è Smart Visual Previews

Intelligently extracts and selects the top 1‚Äì3 best preview images or GIFs from a repository's README and delivers them as a rich media album with every notification.

### üîî Advanced Notification Control

- **Digest Mode**: Switch between instant notifications for every new star, or receive a clean **Daily** or **Weekly** digest of all your new stars at a scheduled time.
- **Pause & Resume**: Temporarily pause and resume all notifications with simple commands, perfect for when you're on a _"starring spree"_.
- **Custom Interval**: Full control over the monitoring frequency, from minutes to hours.

### üîí Completely Private & Secure

- **Owner-Only**: Designed for a single user, the bot is hard-coded to only respond to its configured owner's User ID.
- **Secure Token Storage**: Your GitHub and AI API keys are stored securely.

### üöÄ High-Performance Backend

- **E-Tag Caching**: Implements an advanced E-Tag-based caching system to drastically reduce GitHub API usage and improve performance.
- **Fully Asynchronous**: Built from the ground up using `asyncio` and `pyTelegramBotAPI` (async) for high efficiency.
